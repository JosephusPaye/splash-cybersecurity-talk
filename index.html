          <h2>Why does this matter for Splash of Colour?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>43% of cyberattacks target small organisations</strong>
              &mdash; non-profits are not exempt
            </li>
            <li>
              You hold sensitive data: participant details, health &amp; medical
              forms, children's records, and contact info for CALD community
              members
            </li>
            <li>
              Your community <strong>trusts you</strong> with their personal
              information &mdash; a breach can damage that trust and your
              programs
            </li>
            <li>
              The good news: <strong>most attacks are preventable</strong> with
              basic hygiene
            </li>
          </ul>
          <div class="risk">
            Cybersecurity hygiene = the ongoing routines, behaviours, and best
            practices that reduce vulnerabilities and mitigate risk.
          </div>
        </section>

        <!-- Tip 1 -->
        <section>
          <h2>
            <span class="tip-number">1</span> Keep Software & Systems Up to
            Date
          </h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Outdated software has known security holes that attackers actively
              exploit
            </li>
            <li>
              Vendors release patches specifically to fix these vulnerabilities
            </li>
            <li>
              Enable <strong>automatic updates</strong> wherever possible
              &mdash; on computers, phones, and apps
            </li>
          </ul>
          <div class="risk">
            Unpatched systems are the #1 way attackers get in. The WannaCry
            ransomware attack exploited a vulnerability that had a patch
            available for months.
          </div>
          <div class="action">
            Today: check that auto-updates are turned on for any computers,
            tablets, or phones used for Splash of Colour admin and programs.
          </div>
        </section>

        <!-- Tip 2 -->
        <section>
          <h2>
            <span class="tip-number">2</span> Use Strong, Unique Passwords
          </h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Every account needs a <strong>distinct</strong> password &mdash;
              reusing passwords means one breach exposes everything
            </li>
            <li>
              Aim for <strong>12+ characters</strong> mixing uppercase,
              lowercase, numbers, and symbols
            </li>
            <li>
              Use a <strong>password manager</strong> (e.g. Bitwarden, 1Password)
              to generate and store them securely
            </li>
          </ul>
          <div class="risk">
            81% of data breaches involve weak or reused passwords. If your email
            password is the same as your enrolment system password, one breach
            exposes participant records too.
          </div>
          <div class="action">
            Set up a free password manager like Bitwarden and start migrating
            your most important accounts.
          </div>
        </section>

        <!-- Tip 3 -->
        <section>
          <h2>
            <span class="tip-number">3</span> Enable Multi-Factor Authentication
            (MFA)
          </h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              MFA adds a <strong>second layer</strong> of protection beyond your
              password
            </li>
            <li>
              Typically a one-time code from an app, SMS, or biometric
              verification (fingerprint/face)
            </li>
            <li>
              Even if someone steals your password,
              <strong>they still can't get in</strong> without the second factor
            </li>
          </ul>
          <div class="risk">
            Without MFA, a stolen password = full account access. Phishing
            attacks regularly harvest passwords, but MFA stops them.
          </div>
          <div class="action">
            Enable MFA on your email, banking, and cloud storage accounts first
            &mdash; these are the highest-value targets.
          </div>
        </section>

        <!-- Tip 4 -->
        <section>
          <h2><span class="tip-number">4</span> Back Up Data Regularly</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Backups protect against ransomware, hardware failure, and
              accidental deletion
            </li>
            <li>
              Follow the <strong>3-2-1 rule</strong>:
              <ul>
                <li><strong>3</strong> copies of your data</li>
                <li><strong>2</strong> different storage types (e.g. local + cloud)</li>
                <li><strong>1</strong> copy offsite or in the cloud</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Test your backups</strong> &mdash; a backup you can't
              restore is useless
            </li>
          </ul>
          <div class="risk">
            Ransomware attacks encrypt your files and demand payment.
            Organisations with good backups can recover without paying.
          </div>
          <div class="action">
            Verify that your critical files (participant records, enrolment
            data, medical forms, financials) are being backed up automatically.
          </div>
        </section>

        <!-- Tip 5 -->
        <section>
          <h2>
            <span class="tip-number">5</span> Train Your Team to Spot Threats
          </h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>People are the weakest link</strong> &mdash; and the
              strongest defence when trained well
            </li>
            <li>
              Teach instructors, coordinators, and volunteers to recognise
              phishing emails, suspicious links, and social engineering
            </li>
            <li>
              Be aware that scams may target CALD communities in
              <strong>multiple languages</strong> &mdash; share awareness in
              the languages your community speaks
            </li>
          </ul>
          <div class="risk">
            91% of cyberattacks start with a phishing email. One click on a
            malicious link can compromise your entire organisation.
          </div>
          <div class="action">
            Schedule a short security awareness session for your team. Free
            resources are available from the ACSC (cyber.gov.au) including
            translated materials.

            <span class="tip-number">6</span> Limit Access Using Least
            Privilege
          </h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Give people access to <strong>only what they need</strong> for
              their role &mdash; nothing more
            </li>
            <li>
              Review permissions <strong>each term</strong>, especially after
              instructor or volunteer changes
            </li>
            <li>
              A swimming instructor doesn't need admin access to financial
              systems &mdash; keep roles separated
            </li>
          </ul>
          <div class="risk">
            If a volunteer account with full admin access gets compromised, the

          </div>
          <div class="action">
            Audit who has admin access to your enrolment system, email, and

            <li>

          </ul>
          <div class="risk">
            The average data breach goes undetected for 200+ days. The longer an
